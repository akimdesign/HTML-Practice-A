            <p>Ninety-seven years after a devastating nuclear apocalypse wipes out almost all life on Earth,
                thousands
                of people now live in a space station orbiting Earth, which they call the Ark. Three generations
                have
                been born in space, bringing the population of the Ark beyond carrying capacity. One-hundred
                juvenile
                detainees are sent to Earth in a last attempt to determine whether it is habitable. They discover
                that
                some survived the apocalypse: the grounders, who live in clans locked in a power struggle; the
                Reapers,
                another group of grounders who have been turned into cannibals by the Mountain Men; and the Mountain
                Men, who live in Mount Weather, descended from those who locked themselves away before the
                apocalypse.
                Under the leadership of Bellamy and Clarke, the juveniles attempt to survive the harsh surface
                conditions, battle hostile grounders and establish communication with the Ark.</p>

                <figcaption>Kingdom is a South Korean political period horror series adapted by Netflix</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Set in Koreaâ€™s medieval Joseon period, it tells the story of Crown Prince Lee Chang (Ju Ji-hoon), who
                becomes embroiled in a coup/political conspiracy and is forced to embark upon a mission to
                investigate
                the spread of a mysterious undead plague that has beset the current emperor and the country's
                southern
                provinces. The story starts with a notice written in Korean on a billboard, claiming the king of
                Joseon
                is dead and the crown prince should be crowned immediately as the new king. However, inside the
                palace,
                the king is known to be severely sick and has been secretly treated for the past 10 days. No one was
                allowed to visit the king, not even the crown prince himself. Late at night, the crown prince sneaks
                out
                to visit his father, wanting to know the truth. But instead of his own father, he encountered the
                silhouette of a beastly monster. Accompanied by the physician Seo-bi (Bae Doo-na), the enigmatic
                Yeong-sin (Kim Sung-kyu), and his personal guard Mu-yeong (Kim Sang-ho), Prince Lee Chang must
                prevent
                the advance of the plague towards his home capital of Hanyang (present-day Seoul) while addressing
                the
                sinister coup masterminded by Minister Cho Hak-ju (Ryu Seung-ryong) and his family aimed towards his
                deposition from the throne.</p>
